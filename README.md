# Swap Meet

## Description
Swap Meet was created to help others meet, sell, and trade their possessions. Our services help people post listings through a simple user friendly interface and browse a variety of other listings in their area. These exchanges are not limited to money! Parties can trade and exchange items of equal or lesser value. These values are determined by the involved parties. Here at Swap Meet, we want to ensure that users can have a helpful and easy to use online marketplace to connect with others within their communities.
